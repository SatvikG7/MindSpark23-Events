          <p>
            The Integration Bee is an event for students who enjoy doing
            integral calculus, who like breaking their heads over a single
            integral for the entire day, who like coming up with different ways
            of solving the same integral using a different technique every time,
            students who want to establish their supremacy amongst all the
            integrators in town. This event will test your hold over all the
            methods of integration. It will require the student to be quick with
            their thinking and would test their creative cells and their skills
            as an innovator.

              <h4>Round 1:</h4>
              <p>
                This round will consist of a test paper consisting of indefinite
                and definite integrals; a fixed amount of time will be given to
                every student to take the test. The student will be expected to
                produce the answers to the given integrals correctly by using
                any method or technique she/he finds suitable. Marks will only
                be given to the student if the integral is exactly correct, and
                no other scenario would be considered. Remaining details of the
                test will be declared on the day of the event. The top 16
                students will be selected from this round and will be proceeding
                to the final round.

              <h4>Round 2:</h4>
              <p>
                This is the round where your nerve and mettle will be tested.
                This is the face-off round. In this round top 16 student will be
                pitched against each other. It will be a one-on-one match. In a
                match, a single integral would be announced by the integration
                master and the person who solves it t first would get a point.
                In such a way 5 integrals would be asked in a single match. The
                student who scores more points would win that match. In this
                manner, the top 8 students will be selected, and they will go
                against each other. The format of the match will be same as
                above. Out of the top 8 four will be selected for the
                semi-finals and the top four will go against each other to get a
                place in the finals. In the final showdown between the two
                finalists, the integration master would announce seven integrals
                out of which the finalist who scores more points would win. The
                integrals in this round would be both indefinite and definite.
                The winner of the final match would be crowned as the grand
                integrator and will be awarded the grand prize.

              <p>
                1. 16 people for the preliminary round (5 integrals will be
                given to everyone)<br />2. 8 people will be selected out of 16
                people and each participant will be assigned some other
                participant with whom they will compete for the second round.<br />3.
                Second round will be between 8 people who will be winners of
                first round.<br />4. Third round will be between 4 people who
                will be winners of second round.<br />5. Fourth round is final
                between two people (7 integrals will be given to each
                participant). Third place match will also be conducted.
