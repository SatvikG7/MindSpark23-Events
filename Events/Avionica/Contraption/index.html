          <p>
            Conservation of energy and mass are two rules which govern the
            universe. This event is designed towards converting energy from one
            form to another and driving a series of events that will ultimately
            carry out the given task. The more complicated the contraption and
            the more forms of energy used, the higher the points earned.

                teams are expected to get 4 copies of the printed abstract for
                the event, clearly mentioning steps and chart, which shows all

          <h2># Rules</h2>

          <ol>
            <li>
              The minimum and maximum time for contraption are 2 minutes and 6
              minutes respectively. After 6 minutes, 30 Points per minute will
              be deducted per minute from the total score.
            </li>
            <li>
              The contraption setup is to be developed in an area with
              dimensions 15ft X 20ft, and the height must not cross 5ft; (you
              may have a smaller setup not less than 5ft by 5ft) the setup
              should fit in an imaginary box of the above-mentioned dimensions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Since the event will be held in the badminton court (VENUE) of the
              college, participants are requested to prevent spillage of any
              kind of fluid and should take precautionary measures in case of
              any such step involved.
            </li>
            <li>
              No harmful explosives that may cause harm to the surroundings are
              to be included in the making of the contraption.
            </li>
            <li>
              Two hand touches are allowed without deduction of points. Before
              the 3rd hand touch, the team would be given choice to go for 3rd
              hand touch or to go for the second trial. For 3rd, 4th and 5th
              hand touch, 30, 60, and 120 points will be deducted respectively
              from the total score.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the team decides to go for the second attempt, 50 points will
              be deducted initially, and 2 hand touches will be allowed further
              with a deduction of 50 and 80 points, respectively. The team will
              be disqualified if they exceed the permissible number of hand
              touches (5 for attempt 1; and 2 for attempt 2) in the respective
              trial.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sufficient set-up time will be given and 1 hour will be given for
              each team for first attempt and second attempt of the model
              respectively. Only 2 attempts are allowed.
            </li>
            <li>
              No alteration (without prior notice) in any step will be allowed
              during the trial of the contraption.
            </li>
            <li>
              Students should carry proof of identity issued by their
              institution.
            </li>
            <li>
              The same person cannot be a member of more than one team. All
              teams involving a common person as a participant will be
              disqualified.
            </li>
            <li>
              Participants are required to report at (TIME - to be DECIDED).
            </li>
            <li>
              Participants should take due safety measures in their models.
            </li>
            <li>
              Rules are subject to change without prior intimation. Participants
              are requested to check the MindSpark'23 website
              (www.mind-spark.org) regularly for updates.
            </li>
            <li>
              All decisions of Judges, Event Heads, and Organizers will be final
              and binding to all participants. No arguments shall be
              entertained.

            <li>
              Bring special tools of your own if you think they are important
              for the building of your Contraption.
            </li>
            <li>
              Extension boards for any required power supply will be provided by
              the organising committee.
