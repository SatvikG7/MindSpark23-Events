                        <p>Take-off consists of the participants using a pressure launcher to launch a water bottle rocket into the air. Participants have to construct their own water bottle rocket of a design of their choice. The event comprises three rounds which will be as follows- </p>

                        <h4>Round 1:</h4>
                        <p>The ground will be divided into six concentric zones from the launcher for this round. Further, the ground will be divided into 3 sectors, with each sector containing the mentioned 6 scoring zones. From the launching point, the participant will have to use the launcher to launch the water bottle rocket. The participants will have to choose one of the three sectors towards which they will be launching their rocket. The participant will be given points according to the area in which the rocket lands. If the rocket does not land in the sector chosen by the participant, no points will be awarded. The area and the points that the area holds will be visible during the event. This round will give 3 attempts to each team. The total score of the 3 attempts will be considered.</p>

                        <p>For this round, a target will be declared. Points will be awarded based on the distance between the rocket and the target. The point at which the rocket touches the ground for the first time will be considered, and subsequent bounces/sliding will not be considered.</p>
