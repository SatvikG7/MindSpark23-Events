India is urbanizing rapidly offering great opportunities to build a new nation, while facing challenges in sustainable urban growth. It is a huge task to manage increasing population pressure on existing urban areas and to provide good quality of life to the residents. UTOPIA gives you a chance to explore your abilities to find solutions to city problems. UTOPIA is a platform for the young generation to give a future development plan for a given problem in an innovative manner.<br> <b>ELABORATION OF THE THEME: </b><br>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 15% of the world's population lives with some form of disability. The number of persons with disabilities is increasing due to medical developments, the rise of an aging population, and the spread of chronic diseases. Barriers to full social and economic inclusion of persons with disabilities include inaccessible physical environments and transportation, the unavailability of assistive devices and technologies, non-adapted means of communication, gaps in service delivery, and discriminatory prejudice and stigma in society. As public transport systems reduce or stop services due to COVID-19, persons with disabilities who rely on these methods for accessible transport may not be able to travel, even for basic necessities or critical medical appointments. <br> As Planners, Civil engineers and Architects, it is our responsibility to not only envision but to actualize spaces, cities and structures that represent inclusivity and empower the differently abled. In third world countries like India, we ought to start the paradigm shift from public spaces and facilities. The social infrastructure in these countries has been lagging behind in incorporating disable friendly designs and innovations. The way out is to start by innovating and implementing different ideas in order to determine a tried and tested way of making persons with disability feel at ease in public and private spaces and to break barriers.
